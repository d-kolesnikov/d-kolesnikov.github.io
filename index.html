		<h1>Chapter 1: Learning for the sake of learning</h1>
		<p>Let's start with the <b>basics</b>. I'm just filling some space to have some actual
		content on my website. I don't have any ideas for this yet, but I figured that
		with all the free time I have over the summer, I should put at least <i>some</i> 
		of it to good work. I hope one day I'll have an idea I'm really passionate about,
		and maybe by that time I will have enough programming knowledge to make it happen.
		I will be following Jon Duckett's <i>HTML and CSS Design</i> and writing my webpages
		in <b>Notepad++</b> so that I have complete control over almost every pixel on each
		webpage. Here we go!</p>
